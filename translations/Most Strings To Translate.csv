NEW GAME WITH TRIAL None
Welcome back Wizard, to the ruins of the universe.
Aeons passed while you slumbered.
You have sleptwalk across many worlds.
The universe, once ordered and beautiful, lies in chaos and ruin.
And you as well:
You were a great wizard once, but your magic and your memories have faded.
Your purpose you remember.  Revenge.
The Dark Wizard Mordred is nearby.
Perhaps he is what woke you?
Regain your power, and slay Mordred.
